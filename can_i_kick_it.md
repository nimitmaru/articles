# Can I kick it? Yes you can.

Some of the most common questions that **admits** to Fullstack Academy ask us are: "Am I really ready for this?" "Will I be able to handle it?" "Am I prepared?". If you have been admitted to Fullstack, the answers to all these questions are: YES. The Fullstack Academy interview process is one of the most rigorous in the industry. If you made it through and got accepted, we strongly believe that you are ready to be successful student and developer. Really!

The root of this question, a feeling of, "Am I good enough?" is not only common amongst new admits, but also with current students, many of whom are used to being at the top of their class and are suddenly overwhelmed by the quality of their classmates.

The feeling you may be experiencing is known as the **imposter syndrome**. Despite having external proof that you deserve your accomplishment, you may feel like you are an "imposter," that you're fooling everyone and you fear being "found out." This feeling, which is common with super-smart and deeply committed individuals, usually does not represent reality. 

###Thriving in spite of feeling the imposter syndrome
As a grad student at Wharton, I attended a seminar called, "Why Capable People Suffer from the Impostor Syndrome and How to Thrive in Spite of It" by Valerie Young, an international expert on the topic. Dr. Young described imposter syndrome as "...feelings of inadequacy that persist even in face of information that indicates that the opposite is true."  Here are a few takeaways from her seminar and from experience working with students at Fullstack that I think are helpful:

* **It's natural** to feel this way, especially when you are a high-achiever and used to excellence in your work. It can and does happen to everyone. 
* **Appreciate yourself.** Acknowledge the work you've done to get to this point. Many of you have spent many months studying hard to get to this point. That is not easy, and you've come a long way.
* **Trust the process.** [Many students](http://www.quora.com/Reviews-of-Fullstack-Academy) have gone through this before you and have done perfectly well. You can do it too.
* **Work instead of worry.** Instead spending effort worrying, spend that time preparing yourself further. Solving the underlying problem behind the worry is a lot more effective than actually worrying itself, which usually accomplishes little.
* **Embrace the anxiety.** With anything new, some anxiety is expected. Fighting anxiety only increases it. It is much more effective to embrace it. Admit to yourself you're feeling anxiety and imagine yourself walking into it instead of running from it. "I'm a bit stressed, so what?"
* **Ask for help.** Are you feeling overwhelmed? You can always email us for help. We are more than happy to get on the phone with you and talk you through this decision, or help you in any other way.
* **Learn more.** Read this [HuffPost article](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/dr-valerie-young/impostor-syndrome_b_2271141.html) by Dr. Valerie Young, an expert on this topic to learn more. Also, Google for many more resources to learn more about this topic online.

###We believe in you
Admission to Fullstack is competitve, and our interview process is not easy. We wouldn't have admitted you if we didn't feel confident that you were committed, passionate and prepared enough to be successful. My advice to you is, don't doubt yourself, but be prepared to work hard and make the best of this opportunity. So, the next time you're asking yourself, "Can I kick it?", let the tribe be your guide, **[yes you can](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrlJX7DzLhI)**.
