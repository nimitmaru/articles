# "Can I kick it?" or "How to overcome the imposter syndrome for Fullstack admits"

Some common questions we get from **admits** to Fullstack Academy are: "Am I really ready for this?" "Will I be able to handle it?" "Am I prepared?". What all these highly-qualified candidates are really asking is, "Can I Kick It or Am I really good enough?" If you have been admitted to Fullstack, the answer to all these questions is: YES. The Fullstack Academy interview process is rigorous and technical. If you made it through and got accepted, we strongly believe that you have the right ingredients to be a successful developer.  

The root of the question: "Am I good enough?" is not only common amongst new admits, but also with current students, many of whom are used to being at the top of their class and suddenly feel overwhelmed by the quality of their classmates.

There is a high likelihood that what you're experiencing is the **imposter syndrome**. Despite multiple signs of external proof that you are cut out for the task,  you may begin to feel like you are an "imposter," that you're fooling everyone and you fear being "found out." This feeling, which is common with super-smart and deeply committed individuals, usually does not represent reality. 

###Thriving in spite of feeling the imposter syndrome

As a grad student at Wharton, I attended a seminar called, "Why Capable People Suffer from the Impostor Syndrome and How to Thrive in Spite of It" by Dr. Valerie Young, an international expert on the topic. Dr. Young described imposter syndrome as "...feelings of inadequacy that persist even in face of information that indicates that the opposite is true." This seminar exposed me to just how destructive this feeling can be to your ambition, hope and finally effort. We make a concentrated effort to help students through it at Fullstack. I want to share some of the important takeaways and tips from our experience working with students with you:

* **It's natural** to feel this way, especially when you are a high-achiever and used to excellence in your work. It can and does happen to everyone. 
* **Appreciate yourself.** Acknowledge the work you've done to get to this point. Many of you have spent many months studying hard, doing research, and going through a tough interview process to get to this point. You've come a long way!
* **Trust the process.** [Many students](http://www.quora.com/Reviews-of-Fullstack-Academy) have gone through this before you and have done perfectly well. You can do it too.
* **Work instead of worry.** Instead spending effort worrying, use that time to prepare yourself further. Solving the underlying problem behind the worry is much more effective at making you feel better than the actual worrying itself.
* **Embrace the anxiety.** With anything new, some anxiety is expected. Fighting anxiety only increases it. It is much more effective to embrace it. Admit to yourself you're feeling anxiety and imagine yourself walking into it instead of running from it. "I'm a bit stressed, so what?"
* **Ask for help.** Are you feeling overwhelmed? Ask for help. If you are an admit or attendee of Fullstack, you can always ask us for help. We are more than happy to talk you through this feeling, or help you in any other way.
* **Learn more.** Read this [HuffPost article](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/dr-valerie-young/impostor-syndrome_b_2271141.html) by Dr. Valerie Young, an expert on this topic to learn more. Also, Google for many more resources to learn more about this topic online.
